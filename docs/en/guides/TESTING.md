# Testing SimpleMediator

This guide explains how to exercise the automated test suites that protect SimpleMediator and what each layer is intended to validate.

## Test Layers

| Suite | Project | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Unit tests | `tests/SimpleMediator.Tests` | Behavioural checks for mediators, configuration helpers, and built-in pipeline components. |
| Property tests | `tests/SimpleMediator.PropertyTests` | Configuration and pipeline invariants validated with FsCheck across varied inputs. |
| Contract tests | `tests/SimpleMediator.ContractTests` | Structural safeguards that assert the public surface keeps its interoperability guarantees. |

## Running The Tests

Execute every suite with one command from the repository root:

```pwsh
dotnet test SimpleMediator.sln --configuration Release
```

Use the following filters for a specific layer:

```pwsh
# Unit tests only
dotnet test tests/SimpleMediator.Tests/SimpleMediator.Tests.csproj

# Property tests only
dotnet test tests/SimpleMediator.PropertyTests/SimpleMediator.PropertyTests.csproj

# Contract tests only
dotnet test tests/SimpleMediator.ContractTests/SimpleMediator.ContractTests.csproj
```

## Coverage Snapshot

Run the Release configuration with coverage collection to refresh the stored baseline:

```pwsh
dotnet test --configuration Release --collect "XPlat Code Coverage"
```

Then regenerate the aggregated report:

```pwsh
dotnet tool run reportgenerator -reports:"TestResults/**/*.xml" -targetdir:"artifacts/coverage/latest" -reporttypes:HtmlInline_AzurePipelines;TextSummary
```

The latest HTML and summary output lives under `artifacts/coverage/latest/`.

## Property-Based Testing Notes

Property tests limit selector list sizes to keep execution time predictable. When extending the suite, prefer shrinking-aware generators and keep assertions free of side effects so FsCheck can explore counterexamples efficiently.

## Next Steps

- Add notification pipeline properties to guarantee ordering and error semantics.
- Expand contract tests to cover `ServiceCollectionExtensions` registration expectations.
- Automate coverage publication in CI once the contract suite stabilises.
