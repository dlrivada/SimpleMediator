# SimpleMediator Quality & Testing Roadmap

Last updated: 2025-12-08

## Overview

This roadmap tracks the effort to bring SimpleMediator to the same multi-layered testing maturity as the vacations pilot. It captures scope, current status, and next actions so the work can advance incrementally without losing context.

## Objectives

- Establish comprehensive automated coverage across unit, property-based, contract, integration, mutation, and performance suites.
- Provide reproducible tooling (coverage, benchmarks, mutation) with documented execution steps and quality gates.
- Maintain a live log of progress so each iteration updates status, outcomes, and upcoming work.

- **2025-12-08** — CI now runs `scripts/aggregate-performance-history.cs` after benchmarks, publishing the regenerated benchmark/load tables into the workflow summary for release notes.
- **2025-12-08** — Stabilized `SimpleMediator.LoadTests` at 32×16 workers after caching request handler wrappers; metrics capture now records the run (CPU <0.2%, peak working set ≈69 MB) and updates the load-history table.
- **2025-12-08** — Load harness hooked into CI via `scripts/collect-load-metrics.cs` (30 s, 32×16); `scripts/check-load-metrics.cs` enforces the 1% CPU / 100 MB guard and artifacts are uploaded for history aggregation.
- **2025-12-08** — `scripts/aggregate-performance-history.cs` now parses harness logs so `docs/data/load-history.md` reports send/publish throughput alongside CPU and memory.
- **2025-12-08** — `scripts/check-load-metrics.cs` honors `SIMPLEMEDIATOR_LOAD_MAX_MEAN_CPU` and `SIMPLEMEDIATOR_LOAD_MAX_PEAK_MB`, enabling environment-specific guardrails while keeping CLI overrides available.

- **2025-12-08** — `scripts/check-load-metrics.cs` now parses the matching harness log to echo send/publish mean + percentile throughput in CI summaries alongside the CPU/memory guardrails.
- **2025-12-08** — CI summaries now include sample send/publish error snippets sourced from the harness log, enabling quick diagnosis when load failures surface.
- **2025-12-08** — Throughput guardrails added: `scripts/check-load-metrics.cs` accepts env/CLI minimums for mean/P50/P95 send & publish throughput and fails the run when rates dip below expectations.
- **2025-12-08** — Introduced `ci/load-thresholds.json`; the checker now accepts `--config` to load baseline guardrails before applying env/CLI overrides, and CI consumes this config instead of hardcoded thresholds.
- **2025-12-08** — `scripts/run-benchmarks.cs` now copies BenchmarkDotNet CSV/HTML reports into the artifact root so CI guardrails can locate exported metrics without additional plumbing.
- **2025-12-08** — Relaxed benchmark latency thresholds (2.60 µs send / 2.40 µs publish) to reflect the slower hosted Windows 2025 agents while keeping allocation limits unchanged.

## Upcoming Actions

1. Hold line coverage at ≥90% by deepening `SimpleMediator.SimpleMediator` send/publish edge cases and pairing new unit tests with property-based explorations.
2. Evaluate guardrail defaults after a few CI runs to confirm the percentile data stays within acceptable variance.
3. Promote vetted throughput thresholds into CI defaults (or baseline files) once variance windows are established.

## Execution Plan

### Phase 1 – Mutation & Coverage Hardening

- Pair new mediator edge-case unit tests with mutation-driven survivors to keep the 92.37% score resilient to future refactors.
- Add property-based scenarios that stress cancellation, concurrent notifications, and pipeline reorderings; ensure generators live in `SimpleMediator.PropertyTests` and share factories with unit suites.
- Document the expected workflow for running `scripts/update-mutation-summary.cs` locally so contributors refresh the badge prior to merging.

### Phase 2 – Benchmark & Load Gates

- Capture a comparative benchmark run on CI using the baseline settings, then implement threshold checks that fail when latency regresses by >15% or allocations exceed baseline by 25%.
- Stand up a lightweight NBomber harness focused on command throughput and cancellation churn; commit scripts plus README instructions for local execution.
- Publish the benchmark guidance under `docs/en/guides/PERFORMANCE.md`, including interpretation of counters and expected trend reporting.

### Phase 3 – Requirements & Documentation Closure

- Map each roadmap line item to a concrete requirement identifier and reference those IDs within the testing guides and CI summaries.
- Flesh out `docs/en/guides/REQUIREMENTS.md` with traceability tables tying scenarios to unit/property/contract/integration suites.
- Add a “quality checklist” snippet to the README that highlights coverage, mutation, performance, and load entry points so the project advertises full testing maturity.
